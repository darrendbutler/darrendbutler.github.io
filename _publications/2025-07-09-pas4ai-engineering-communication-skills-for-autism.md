Software project courses too often focus instruction on technical skills 
but leave necessary communication and teamwork skills as an
exercise for the learner. When autistic students take these courses,
they often find difficulty fitting into teams with non-autistic students because of their different styles of communication.
To explore how to help autistic students adapt to non-autistic normative software engineering
environments, we designed and taught a first-of-its-kind online project course on AI, explicitly teaching communication and teamwork skills with purposefully designed
scaffolds. After the course, students were matched with profes-
sional, online summer internships in which they could apply the
skills they learned. We detail the course structure, including the
pedagogical strategies employed and the specific challenges en-
countered. Our experiences reveal key elements that contributed to
the course’s success, such as the importance of adaptive teaching
methods and the need for carefully considered instructor training
for teaching neurodivergent learners in software engineering. We
share this report to provide guidance for educators, researchers,
and advocates seeking to develop effective computing education
programs that include autistic students.
